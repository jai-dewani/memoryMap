This was build while completing a challenge called ["Build Your Own Redis"](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis) on CodeCrafters

In this challenge, you'll build a toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`. Along the way we'll learn about
event loops, the Redis protocol and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
